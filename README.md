## Project Description:
### Overview
Our project aims to revolutionize IT management by consolidating a comprehensive suite of tools into a single, unified platform. Inspired by the success of initiatives like Security Onion, we are building an all-encompassing solution that combines the power of various open-source tools within a centralized user interface.

### Key Objectives:

- **Integration of Open-Source Tools:** We seek to incorporate a variety of open-source tools with our core RMM application such as Netbox for network documentation and management, UVDesk for helpdesk and ticketing support, and CheckMK network monitoring, expanding its functionality to cover a wide range of IT management tasks.

- **Modular Design Based on User Roles:** Our approach emphasizes modularity based on user roles, ensuring that users are presented with and have access to the relevant tools needed based on their assigned role. This granular access control optimizes user experience and enhances security.

- **Singular Deployment, Comprehensive Functionality:** By consolidating multiple IT management tools into a single deployment, we aim to simplify the setup process and streamline workflow for administrators. Our goal is to provide users with a "one-stop shop" for all their IT management needs.

### Vision:
We envision our project as an "IT Department-in-a-Box," offering organizations of all sizes the ability to efficiently manage their IT infrastructure with minimal overhead. By democratizing access to powerful tools and streamlining deployment processes, we aim to empower IT professionals with a robust and streamlined toolset to be effect and efficient.
